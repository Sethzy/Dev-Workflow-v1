**Note:** This phase is strictly frontend-only. No backend or real API integration should be implemented at this stage.

- Focus solely on UI/UX using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn.
- Use only mock data and mock APIsâ€”no real backend, auth, or database work.
- Ignore all backend logic until the frontend design is approved.
