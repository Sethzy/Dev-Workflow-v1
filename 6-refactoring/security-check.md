“Audit my project for security issues: public Supabase endpoints, unsecured API routes, weak or missing access control, and improperly configured auth rules. Specifically: 1. Check if Supabase tables or RPC functions are publicly accessible without proper Row Level Security (RLS) or role-based permissions. 2. Confirm that users can’t upgrade their own account privileges or delete/edit other users’ data. 3. Ensure all write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are protected by server-side auth and validation, not just client checks. 4. Identify any hardcoded secrets, misconfigured environment variables, or sensitive data leaks. 5. Generate a security checklist based on my current stack and suggest immediate high-priority fixes.
Assume I want to go from a vibe-coded prototype to a real production-ready app. Refactor anything risky, and explain what you’re doing as you go.”
